#Object

Object refers to an independent entity that contains variables and behavior
Objects interect with each other through method calls- these method calls are
used to both request information from objects and give instructions.

A ***class*** contains the blueprint needed to create objects, and also defines
the objects' variables and methods. An object is created on the basis of the class constructor

The state of an object is the value of its internal variables at any given point in time.

#Class

A class defines the types of objects that can be created from it. It contains
instance variables describing the object's data, a constructor used to create it
and methods that define its behavior.
