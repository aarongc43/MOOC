#Object

Object refers to an independent entity that contains variables and behavior
Objects interect with each other through method calls- these method calls are
used to both request information from objects and give instructions.

A ***class*** contains the blueprint needed to create objects, and also defines
the objects' variables and methods. An object is created on the basis of the class constructor

The state of an object is the value of its internal variables at any given point in time.

#Class

    A class defines the types of objects that can be created from it. It contains
    instance variables describing the object's data, a constructor used to create it
    and methods that define its behavior.

#Method Overloading

    Methods can be overloaded in the same way as constructors.
    Parameters of the different versions must be different.

#Objects and References

A constructor call return the reference to an object. A ***reference*** is information 
about the location of object data.

#Object as a Method Parameter

Since objects are reference variables. any type of object can be defined to be a method parameter.

# Object as objecrt Variable
